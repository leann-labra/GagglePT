# GagglePT

## Description

The motivation for this project is to build an application that allows a user to make a code-related inquiry and receive a curated response. The user will be able to have a deeper understanding of code from the examples and explanations the chatbot will provide. GagglePt will be designed in such a way that the user can save specific chats and reference them at a later time. It will be a precious tool in any developer's life!

In completing this project, we have learned the basic concepts of utilizing MERN.
